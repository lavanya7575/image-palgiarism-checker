# Image Plagiarism Checker

## Overview
The Image Plagiarism Checker is an advanced tool designed to identify instances of image plagiarism. By analyzing and comparing submitted images against a comprehensive dataset, this tool aims to detect unauthorized use or duplication of images. It serves as a valuable asset in digital content creation, education, and content management, ensuring the integrity and originality of visual content.

## Objectives
- Develop a system capable of assessing potential image plagiarism, including exact copies, near duplicates, or derivative works.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for individuals to upload images for plagiarism checks.

## Development Strategy

### Dataset Collection
A diverse dataset of original and modified images is assembled to train and test the model, ensuring wide coverage and accuracy.

### Model Selection and Utilization
Leverage pre-trained models from Hugging Face, such as ResNet, VGG, EfficientNet, or Vision Transformer, for effective feature extraction from images.

### Plagiarism Detection Logic
Implement sophisticated algorithms to compare features of uploaded images against the dataset to accurately identify potential plagiarism.

### User Interface Development
Develop a web interface that enables easy uploading of images for plagiarism checking, ensuring a seamless user experience.

### Testing and Validation
Conduct rigorous testing to validate the system's accuracy and efficiency in detecting image plagiarism.

### Deployment
Deploy the tool for user access and collect feedback for ongoing improvement and refinement.

## Tools and Technologies
